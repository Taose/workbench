### Taose's Work Bench Fork ###
This mod forks kilbith's workbench and applie not just a more sensible repair time and efficiency ratio 
but also two new (credit to kilbeth originating art) hammers of wood and bronze varieties. These two hammers are successively better at repairing and more resistant to wear. 

Should be good for about five uses per hammer of an equivalent tool. 

Additionally and perhaps more usefully, when nearing end of life, the hammers can be "salvaged", this saves an ingot from the worn hammer for re-use. 

v0.1 <br /> 
-  Added Salvaging features to hammers so that they aren't entirely wasted. 
-  Added additional hammers of varying strengths to work well with the "levelling" system
-  Adjusted the rates of wear and repair to be more friendly to gameplay.
