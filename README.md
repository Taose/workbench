### Taose's Work Bench Fork ###
This mod forks kilbith's workbench and applie not just a more sensible repair time and efficiency ratio 
but also two new (credit to kilbeth originating art) hammers of wood and bronze varieties. These two hammers are successively better at repairing and more resistant to wear. 

Should be good for about five uses per hammer of an equivalent tool.
